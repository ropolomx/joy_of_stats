# Session 1

## Theory: Introduction to Correlation
## Practice: Introduction to R and RStudio

Portions on the R code for the introduction to R and RStudio portion of this

by Peter Kruczkiewicz (Public Health Agency of Canada). Portions of the R code for the exercise on correlation were re-used or 
modified from other sources including [STHDA's correlation matrix tutorial](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/correlation-matrix-a-quick-start-guide-to-analyze-format-and-visualize-a-correlation-matrix-using-r-software)
